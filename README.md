# 🇪🇺 Transition Bonds: The New Greenwashing? — Credibility & Policy Analysis

> **A data-driven policy and credibility risk analysis** of transition bonds in Europe's debt market.  
> Combines real issuance data, ESG scoring trends, and regulatory context to ask: *Are transition bonds truly financing decarbonization — or are they another form of greenwashing?*

- Identify credibility gaps for investors & issuers
- Explore ESG data to validate market claims
- Connect market data to real-life policy implications

## 🌍 **Real-life context & why this matters**

Despite rapid growth, transition bonds:
- Often fund high-emission sectors without strict decarbonization KPIs
- Lack standard taxonomy enforcement
- Carry reputational & policy risks if markets tighten (e.g., EU Green Bond Standard)

**Result:** Investors & regulators face a credibility gap threatening sustainable finance targets.
