# 📊 Transition Bonds Europe: Gap, Risk, Data & Policy Analysis

> **A professional research & data analytics project exploring credibility gaps, policy risk, and country-level exposure in European transition bonds.**  
> Combines data science, financial analysis, and ESG policy review to assess whether transition bonds drive real impact — or just greenwashing.
